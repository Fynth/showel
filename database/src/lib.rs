//! Common database driver traits and error types used by all Shovel database
//! drivers.
//!
//! This crate defines the [`DatabaseDriver`] trait — the core abstraction that
//! every database backend (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, ClickHouse) must
//! implement. Each driver crate in the workspace (`driver-sqlite`,
//! `driver-postgres`, `driver-mysql`, `driver-clickhouse`) provides its own
//! implementation of this trait, supplying a concrete pool type, error type,
//! and configuration type.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The [`DatabaseDriver`] trait is deliberately minimal: it defines only a
//! single async `connect` method. This keeps the contract between the
//! connection layer and individual drivers as simple as possible. Higher-level
//! functionality — query execution, schema exploration, row editing — is built
//! on top of the pool type returned by `connect` and lives in crates such as
//! `query-core`, `explorer`, and `connection`.
//!
//! # Associated types
//!
//! Each implementation of [`DatabaseDriver`] specifies three associated types:
//!
//! * [`Pool`](DatabaseDriver::Pool) — A managed pool of database connections
//!   (e.g. `r2d2::Pool<SqliteConnectionManager>` for SQLite,
//!   `deadpool_postgres::Pool` for PostgreSQL).
//! * [`Error`](DatabaseDriver::Error) — The error type returned by the driver’s
//!   connection logic.
//! * [`Config`](DatabaseDriver::Config) — The driver-specific configuration
//!   type that aggregates host, port, credentials, TLS settings, and any other
//!   parameters needed to open a connection.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! All pool, error, and config types are owned by the implementing crate. This
//! crate does not expose any concrete error enum or configuration struct; it
//! only publishes the trait contract.

/// A generic trait for establishing a connection pool to a database.
///
/// `DatabaseDriver` is the primary abstraction at the boundary between the
/// connection-orchestration layer and the individual database backends.
/// Each driver crate provides one implementation (e.g. `SqliteDriver`,
/// `PostgresDriver`, `MySqlDriver`, `ClickHouseDriver`).
///
/// # Type parameters (associated types)
///
/// * [`Pool`](DatabaseDriver::Pool) — The type of the connection pool.
///   Implementations typically wrap a third-party pooling crate such as
///   `r2d2`, `deadpool`, or `bb8`.
/// * [`Error`](DatabaseDriver::Error) — The error type for connection
///   operations. Drivers may define their own error enum or reuse one from
///   an underlying client library.
/// * [`Config`](DatabaseDriver::Config) — Driver-specific configuration. This
///   must be enough information to locate and authenticate against a database
///   instance. For example, a PostgreSQL configuration might include host,
///   port, database name, user, password, and SSL mode.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// The [`connect`](DatabaseDriver::connect) method returns
/// [`Err(Self::Error)`](DatabaseDriver::Error) when it cannot establish a
/// connection to the database. This can happen for many reasons: invalid
/// credentials, unreachable host, network timeouts, TLS handshake failures,
/// or an invalid connection string. The caller is expected to propagate or
/// log the error appropriately.
